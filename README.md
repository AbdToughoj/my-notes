## 1)git clone **[*url*]**
 ### "retrieve an entire repository from a hosted location via URL"
 
## 2)git add **[*file*]**
 ### "add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage)"

## 3)git commit **-m “[*descriptive message*]”**
 ### "commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot"

## 4)git push
 ### "to upload local repository content to a remote repository"
